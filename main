            This program will do several things.
            First, it will ask for a file name. The file MUST end in '.txt'.
            Upon reading the file, it will seperate every word, based entirely on whitespaces. 
            Words can only have letters and hyphens.
            Then it will ask the user this up to 10 times unless the user says no or it reaches the limited amount of times.
            The program will then prompt you for a word.
            The program will then inform you of the amount of times that your word appears.
            The program is not case sensitive.
            The program will then ask you if you wish to repeat.
            If you don't, it will present a summary and terminate.
